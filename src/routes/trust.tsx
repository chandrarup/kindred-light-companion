                Daily logs, photos, notes, and care-circle membership are
                stored in our managed Postgres database with row-level access
                rules so a household's data is only visible to its members.

                Photos are kept in a private storage bucket and served through

                Records become read-only after a configurable edit-lock window

                The Ask Companion chat in Demo Mode uses synthetic responses

                are routed back to the care team.
